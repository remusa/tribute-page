                    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates" id="tribute-link" target="_blank"><strong>Socrates</strong></a>
                        was born circa 470
                        BC,
                        in Athens,
                        Greece. We know of his life through the writings of his students,
                        including Plato and Xenophon. His "Socratic method," laid the groundwork for Western systems of
                        logic and philosophy. When the political climate of Greece turned,
                        Socrates was sentenced to death by hemlock poisoning in 399 BC. He accepted this judgment
                        rather than fleeing into exile. </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>It was around 470 BC when Socrates was born in Athens,
                            Greece. </li>
                        <li>Socrates’ father was Sophroniscus,
                            a sculptor and stone mason from Athens and his mother was a midwife by the name of
                            Phaenarete. </li>
                        <li>He received basic Greek education because he did not belong to a noble family and hence,
                            he learned the skills of his father at a very early age. </li>
                        <li>Before turning a philosopher,
                            Socrates took up masonry and sculpting as his profession for several years. </li>
                        <li>According to the records of his students named Aristophanes and Xenophon,
                            Socrates used to take money for teaching and that was his only source of income that helped
                            Socrates to sustain a livelihood. </li>
                        <li>Contrary to the records of Aristophanes and Xenophon,
                            Plato,
                            one of the most popular disciples of Socrates said in his records that Socrates simply
                            denied receiving any payments for tutoring his students and hence,
                            lively a very lowly and poor lifestyle. </li>
                        <li>Xanthippe was Socrates’ wife. The two had three children by the names Menexenus,
                            Sophroniscus and Lamprocles. </li>
                        <li>According to Socrates’ disciple Xenophon,
                            Xanthippe was not happy with the ‘philosopher’ profession of Socrates and complained that
                            he did not support his own family. </li>
                        <li>According to Xenophon,
                            Socrates was far more interested in intellectual upbringing of young minds of Athens rather
                            than looking after the upbringing of his own sons. </li>
                        <li>According to Plato’s records,
                            Socrates served citizen soldier in battles of Potidaea,
                            Amphipolis and Delium during the Peloponnesian War. Plato’s records state than Socrates
                            served as a hoplite (armored infantry) as per Athenian law and was absolutely fearless and
                            courageous in battlefield. </li>
